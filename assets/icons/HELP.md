## What's happening here?!
You can find `svg` icons for all things dev here at [devicons.github.io](https://devicons.github.io/devicon/). Since for now for security reasons there is no way to load these files directly into your `README.md` files, after downloading and customizing the icons you should upload them and convert them to `png` files. You can use [svgtopng.com](https://svgtopng.com/) for this step.

If there is a proper way to use an svg file in a markdown file, please open an issue and let me know :)
